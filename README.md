***Todo App***


This is a simple Todo application built with React and Tailwind CSS. The app allows users to add, update, delete, and toggle the completion status of their tasks. The todos are persisted in the browser's localStorage, ensuring that the data is not lost on page reloads.

***Features***


**Add Todos:** Enter a task in the input field and click "Add" to include it in your todo list.


**Update Todos:** Edit the task description by clicking the "Edit" button, modifying the text, and then saving it.


**Delete Todos:** Remove a task from the list by clicking the "Delete" button.


**Toggle Completion:** Mark tasks as completed or incomplete by clicking the checkbox next to each task.


**Persist Data:** Todos are stored in localStorage to persist data across page reloads.
